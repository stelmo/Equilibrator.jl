# eQuilibrator.jl
eQuilibrator.jl is a lightweight interface to the Python package
[equilibrator_api](https://gitlab.com/equilibrator/equilibrator-api), which
provides a programmatic way to make use of the functionality of
[eQuilibrator](https://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/). This is particularly
useful when one needs access to thermodynamic information about reactions or
compounds.
